# VHDL ~ Digital Logic Design Project
Politecnico di Milano - Accademic Year 2020-2021

<img src="equalization.jpg" width="400" />

The whole project was implemented in `VHDL` language utilizing `Xilinx Vivado Webpack`.
## Goal
Creation of a hardware component adopting Field Programmable Logic Gate Arrays (FPGA) whose purpose is to achieve the equalization of the histogram of an image.
This procedure is designed to recalibrate the contrast of an image by distributing the intensity values along the entire range of possible values.
